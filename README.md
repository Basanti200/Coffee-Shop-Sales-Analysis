# Overview

The Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project is a data-driven initiative focused on examining and visualizing sales data from a fictional coffee shop chain. This project integrates SQL for data extraction and transformation, along with Power BI to create compelling visual representations. The main goal is to uncover actionable insights that will help the coffee shop chain optimize operations, increase sales, and improve customer satisfaction.

#Data Acquisition
The project begins with gathering raw sales data, which may include information on customer orders, product details, purchase dates, and transaction values. This data is sourced from various platforms, such as databases, CSV files, or other data storage systems.

#Data Transformation with SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to clean, filter, and transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. This step involves tasks like joining tables, aggregating data, handling missing values, and creating calculated fields.

#Data Analysis
After preparing the data, an in-depth analysis is conducted using SQL queries. This analysis may cover:

Identifying the most popular coffee flavors.
Analyzing sales patterns across different time periods.
Understanding customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
Calculating average transaction values.
Evaluating the performance of individual coffee shop locations.

#Power BI Visualization

Power BI is used to create interactive visualizations that effectively communicate the insights gained from the data analysis. The visualizations may include:

Bar charts and pie charts showing sales by product category.
Time series charts depicting sales trends.
Dashboards summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs).
