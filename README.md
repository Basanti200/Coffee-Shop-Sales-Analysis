# Overview

-The Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project is a data-driven initiative focused on examining and visualizing sales data from a fictional coffee shop chain. < br / >This project integrates SQL for data extraction and transformation, along with Power BI to create compelling visual representations. <br/>The main goal is to uncover actionable insights that will help the coffee shop chain optimize operations, increase sales, and improve customer satisfaction.

#Data Acquisition

-The project begins with gathering raw sales data, which  includes information on customer orders, product details, purchase dates, and transaction values. < br / >This data is sourced from database.

#Data Transformation with SQL
-SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to clean, filter, and transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. < br / >This step involves tasks like joining tables, aggregating data, handling missing values, and creating calculated fields.

#Data Analysis
-After preparing the data, an in-depth analysis is conducted using SQL queries. This analysis covers:< br / >
-Identifying the most popular coffee flavors.< br / >
-Analyzing sales patterns across different time periods.< br / >
-Understanding customer demographics and purchasing behavior.< br / >
-Calculating average transaction values.< br / >
-Evaluating the performance of individual coffee shop locations.< br / >

#Power BI Visualization

Power BI is used to create interactive visualizations that effectively communicate the insights gained from the data analysis. The visualizations includes:< br / >

-Bar charts and pie charts showing sales by product category.< br / >
-Time series charts depicting sales trends.< br / >
-Dashboards summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs).
